      <description>What Is OpenStack? For those of you who have not heard of &amp;ldquo;OpenStack&amp;rdquo; or the OpenStack Foundation, you might be wondering what it is.
Wikipedia &amp;ldquo;currently&amp;rdquo; defines it as an a free and open-source software platform for cloud computing, mostly deployed
as an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS).
While that is true, it is incomplete and unless you know what infrastructure as a service is it&amp;rsquo;s not very helpful.
Granted the Wikipedia page does actually explain what OpenStack is and what OpenStack does but ill have a go anyway.</description>
