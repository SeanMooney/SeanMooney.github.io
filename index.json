[{"content":"What Is OpenStack? For those of you who have not heard of \u0026ldquo;OpenStack\u0026rdquo; or the OpenStack Foundation, you might be wondering what it is. Wiki defines it as an a free and open-source software platform for cloud computing, mostly deployed as an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS).\nWhile that is true, it is incomplete and unless you know what infrastructure as a service is it\u0026rsquo;s not very helpful.Granted the wiki page does actually explain what OpenStack and what OpenStack does but ill have a go anyway. So OpenStack as software, is a collection of composable interrelated projects primarily written in python, for creating private and public clouds environments.\nOpenStack provides an abstraction layer that allows a collection of servers to be managed as pools of compute, storage and networking services. compute, storage and networking are the 3 pillars of IT service that make up a standard IT infrastructure. As OpenStack provides a software interface to manage these 3 pillars of IT infrastructure it is an Infrastructure as a service offering.\nThe project that makes up OpenStack IaaS offering are what used to be know as the OpenStack core projects.\nCore Projects: Nova: Compute Project Neutron: Networking Project keystone: Autentication Project Glance: Images as a service Project Cinder: Block Storeage Project swift: Object Storage Project Non-Core projects?: But if there is a Core then are there more non-core projects? For OpenStack that is a resounding YES!!! in fact since the creation of the big tent and arguably before, the compendium of OpenStack and OpenStack related projects has been expanding beyond IaaS to Orchestration, Platform as a service, advanced services such as container orchestration and support services such as workflow engines, database as a service, backup as a service and many other micro services that can be composed to build your own OpenStack-powered application.\nA listing of offical project teams can be found in the openstack govournace repo and many other affilated projects can be found by exploring the openstack namesace on github.\nHow mature are all test projects? With all these core and non-core project to choose for do I need them all? How mature are they really? Are they all ready to use in my production application?\nWell, the answer to the first question is simple, OpenStack is a composition of micro services that work together to provide a could of your own design. if you don\u0026rsquo;t need object storage then you can deploy without swift, already have ceph deployed? no problem you can have cinder,nova and glance use that as your storage backend. do you want DNS as a service by not orchestration? you can deploy designate but leave heat out of your cloud deployment.\nThe second question of how mature these projects are is a little harder to answer. The OpenStack Core project have matured over many releases to be stable and production ready, the advanced services are at a differing level of maturity but luckily the OpenStack foundation has been developing a tool to help you make up your own mind.\nThe OpenStack Project Navigator is a great place to start and if you still have question the reaching out to the comunity is as easy as jumping on irc or sending a mail to the mailing list.\nFuture Reading Openstack homepage Openstack software overview Openstack architecture 10,000 feet intro to neutron Openstack Foundation youtube ","permalink":"https://www.seanmooney.info/blog/what-is-openstack/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"what-is-openstack\"\u003eWhat Is OpenStack?\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor those of you who have not heard of \u0026ldquo;OpenStack\u0026rdquo; or the \u003ca href=\"http://openstack.org\"\u003eOpenStack Foundation\u003c/a\u003e,\nyou might be wondering what it is.
